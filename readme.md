# Spring Celebration 2025 Project
my groups project for the Ken Garff Esports Spring Celebration Coding Competition

## TODO:
* Implement audio
* Do some small polishing
    - We need a sewing needle in sewing
    - We need a background for sewing, and soldering
* *Add more minigames*
    - **Not as needed anymore but still would be cool if we had time**
    - first idea off the top of my head is a Welding like one, and a cooking one
